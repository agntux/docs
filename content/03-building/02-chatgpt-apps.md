# Building ChatGPT Apps

ChatGPT Apps are interactive applications that run within ChatGPT, providing specialized functionality and rich user interfaces.

## What are ChatGPT Apps?

ChatGPT Apps allow developers to create interactive experiences directly within ChatGPT. These apps can:

- Provide specialized tools and capabilities
- Display rich, interactive user interfaces
- Integrate with external services and APIs
- Enhance ChatGPT's functionality for specific use cases

For more information, see [OpenAI's introduction to Apps in ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/).

## Key Concepts

### Apps SDK

The OpenAI Apps SDK provides the foundation for building ChatGPT Apps. It uses MCP as its backbone and enables:

- UI component creation
- Tool integration
- Resource management
- Communication with ChatGPT

### UI Components

ChatGPT Apps support interactive UI built with standard web technologies:

- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for interactivity
- Standard browser APIs (with security restrictions)

### Integration Points

Apps integrate with ChatGPT through:

- **Tools** - Functions that the app can call
- **Resources** - Data and content the app can access
- **UI Resources** - Interactive interfaces displayed to users

## Development Workflow

1. **Plan your app** - Define functionality and user experience
2. **Set up development environment** - Install SDK and dependencies
3. **Build UI components** - Create interactive interfaces
4. **Implement tools** - Add backend functionality
5. **Test locally** - Use development tools to test your app
6. **Prepare for submission** - Follow OpenAI's guidelines
7. **Submit for review** - When submission process opens (before end of 2025)

## Best Practices

- Design for conversational context - Apps should feel natural within ChatGPT
- Provide clear user feedback - Interactive elements should be responsive
- Handle errors gracefully - Show helpful error messages
- Follow security guidelines - Ensure your app is secure and respects user privacy
- Optimize performance - Keep UI responsive and efficient
