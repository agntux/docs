# Getting Started with Building

Building ChatGPT Apps and MCP Apps involves understanding both the underlying protocols and the tools available for development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin building, you should have:

- Basic understanding of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Familiarity with REST APIs and JSON
- Understanding of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) basics
- Development environment set up (Node.js, Python, or Ruby depending on your chosen SDK)

## Choosing Your Platform

### Building ChatGPT Apps

ChatGPT Apps are built using the **OpenAI Apps SDK** and are designed to run within ChatGPT. Key considerations:

- Apps must follow OpenAI's guidelines and policies
- UI is built using standard web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- Apps integrate with ChatGPT's conversational interface
- Submission process will be available before end of 2025

### Building MCP Apps

MCP Apps are built using the **MCP protocol** and can work across multiple host applications. Key considerations:

- Apps use the MCP Apps Extension (SEP-1865) for UI capabilities
- UI resources are declared and linked to tools
- Apps can work with any MCP-compatible host
- More flexible deployment options

## Development Tools

Various SDKs and tools are available:

- **TypeScript SDKs** - For Node.js/TypeScript development
- **Python SDKs** - For Python-based development
- **Ruby SDKs** - For Ruby development
- **MCP-UI SDKs** - Community-maintained tools with rich UI support

## Next Steps

The following sections will cover:
- Setting up your development environment
- Creating your first app
- Building interactive UIs
- Integrating with tools and resources
