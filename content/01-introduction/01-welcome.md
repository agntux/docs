# Welcome

Welcome to the AgntUX Documentation and Knowledge Base! This website serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and building **ChatGPT Apps** and **MCP Apps** - two powerful new paradigms for creating interactive AI applications.

## What is This Website?

This documentation site has two primary purposes:

### 1. Public Knowledge Base

First and foremost, this is a **public knowledge base** that brings together all available information about ChatGPT Apps and MCP Apps. The AI agent space is evolving rapidly, with developments happening across multiple companies and open-source communities. This site consolidates that information in one place, making it easier to stay current with the latest developments.

### 2. AgntUX Product Documentation

Once AgntUX launches publicly, this site will also serve as the official product documentation for **AgntUX** - an AI agent that helps users plan, design, build, and deploy ChatGPT Apps and MCP Apps.

## Why This Knowledge Repository is Needed

The space is moving quickly, and it can be difficult to keep up with everything happening. Various efforts across different companies and open-source groups have not yet merged into a cohesive solution. This repository helps bridge that gap by:

- **Curating information** from multiple sources (GitHub issues, blog posts, announcements, Stack Overflow, etc.)
- **Summarizing and organizing** content in a logical, easy-to-navigate structure
- **Staying current** with daily automated updates

## Automated Content Updates

Behind the scenes, an AI agent automatically updates the content in this repository on a daily basis. The agent:

- Monitors GitHub issues, new articles, blog posts, and announcements
- Tracks Stack Overflow discussions and community conversations
- Summarizes and curates relevant information
- Creates pull requests with updates
- A human reviewer then reviews and merges the PRs

This ensures the documentation stays current with the rapidly evolving landscape of ChatGPT Apps and MCP Apps.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have updates, corrections, new examples, or troubleshooting information to share, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/agntux/docs/pulls). Your contributions help keep this knowledge base accurate and comprehensive for all developers building ChatGPT Apps and MCP Apps.
