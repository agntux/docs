# Current State of Affairs

This section provides an overview of where things currently stand with the development of ChatGPT Apps and MCP Apps, what's possible to build today, and what's coming next.

## What Can Be Built Today

### ChatGPT Apps

ChatGPT Apps are interactive applications that run within ChatGPT, providing rich user interfaces and specialized functionality. As of late 2024, developers can:

- Build apps using the OpenAI Apps SDK
- Create interactive UIs with HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Deploy apps that integrate with ChatGPT's conversational interface
- Submit apps for review (OpenAI plans to begin accepting submissions before the end of 2025)

### MCP Apps

MCP Apps are applications built on the Model Context Protocol that can work across multiple AI host applications. Currently, you can:

- Build MCP servers that expose tools and resources
- Create interactive UI components using the MCP Apps Extension (SEP-1865)
- Deploy apps that work with various MCP-compatible hosts
- Use standardized patterns for UI resources and tool integration

## Development Status

Both ChatGPT Apps and MCP Apps are in active development, with new features and capabilities being added regularly. The ecosystem is rapidly evolving as more companies and open-source projects contribute to the standards and tooling.
