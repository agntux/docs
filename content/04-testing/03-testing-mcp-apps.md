# Testing MCP Apps

MCP Apps can be tested using various tools and methods. This section covers the primary testing approaches for MCP Apps.

## Using Postman

Postman is a versatile API client that allows you to test MCP servers by sending JSON-RPC requests directly to your endpoints.

### Setting Up Postman

1. **Install and Configure:**
   - Install Postman and open it
   - Create a new request and set the method to **POST**
   - Set the URL to your MCP server's endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/mcp`)

2. **Configure Headers:**
   - Add necessary headers:
     - `Content-Type: application/json`
     - Authentication tokens if required by your server

3. **Configure Request Body:**
   - Set the body type to **raw** and format to **JSON**
   - Create a JSON-RPC request following the MCP protocol:
     ```json
     {
       "jsonrpc": "2.0",
       "id": 1,
       "method": "tools/list",
       "params": {}
     }
     ```

4. **Send Requests and Analyze:**
   - Click **Send** to execute the request
   - Review the response status, headers, and body
   - Test various MCP methods (see Common MCP Methods below)

5. **Automate Testing:**
   - Use Postman's collection runner to automate a series of tests
   - Create test scripts to validate responses
   - Set up environments for different testing scenarios (local, staging, production)

### Common MCP JSON-RPC Methods to Test

- `initialize` - Establish connection with the server
- `tools/list` - Retrieve all available tools
- `tools/call` - Execute a tool with parameters
- `resources/list` - Get list of available resources
- `resources/read` - Read a specific resource
- `prompts/list` - List available prompts
- `prompts/get` - Get a specific prompt

### Example Postman Requests

**Initialize Connection:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {},
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "postman-test",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

**List Tools:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/list",
  "params": {}
}
```

**Call a Tool:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "my_tool",
    "arguments": {
      "param1": "value1"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using MCPJam

MCPJam is a specialized development environment and playground designed for testing and building MCP applications. It provides an interactive interface for testing MCP-UI apps.

### Setting Up MCPJam

1. **Install and Configure:**
   - Install MCPJam according to your development environment
   - Configure it to point to your MCP server's endpoint
   - Ensure your server is running and accessible

2. **Create Test Scenarios:**
   - Define test cases that cover different functionalities:
     - UI rendering tests
     - Tool execution tests
     - Resource access tests
     - Communication flow tests
     - Error handling tests

3. **Execute Tests:**
   - Run the test scenarios and monitor outputs in real-time
   - Observe UI components as they render
   - Verify tool calls and responses
   - Check bidirectional communication flows

4. **Analyze Results:**
   - Review logs and reports generated by MCPJam
   - Identify any issues or unexpected behaviors
   - Debug communication problems
   - Validate UI rendering across different scenarios

### MCPJam Features

- Interactive UI testing environment
- Real-time MCP protocol inspection
- Visual debugging of UI components
- Support for testing multiple hosts
- Rendering-only mode for UI validation

For more information, see the [MCPJam Documentation](https://mcpjam.com/).

## Testing with Other Hosts

In addition to Postman and MCPJam, you can test your MCP Apps with various MCP-compatible hosts. Each host may have different levels of support, so testing across multiple hosts is important.

### Nanobot

- **Support Level:** Full support for MCP Apps (rendering and UI actions)
- **Use Cases:**
  - Test complete app functionality
  - Verify tool execution and UI interactions
  - Test bidirectional communication
- **Documentation:** [Nanobot Documentation](https://nanobot.dev/)

### Goose

- **Support Level:** Partial support (rendering and basic interactions)
- **Use Cases:**
  - Test UI rendering
  - Verify basic tool functionality
  - Test with productivity-focused host
- **Documentation:** [Goose Documentation](https://goose.ai/)

### LibreChat

- **Support Level:** Partial support
- **Use Cases:**
  - Test compatibility with open-source ChatGPT alternative
  - Verify multi-provider support
  - Test in self-hosted environment
- **Documentation:** [LibreChat Documentation](https://docs.librechat.ai/)

### Smithery

- **Support Level:** Rendering only
- **Use Cases:**
  - Test UI rendering without interactive features
  - Verify fallback behaviors
  - Test in conversational AI context
- **Documentation:** [Smithery Documentation](https://smithery.ai/)

### fast-agent

- **Support Level:** Rendering only
- **Use Cases:**
  - Test lightweight agent framework
  - Verify basic rendering capabilities
  - Test performance in minimal environment

## Testing Considerations

### Host Support Levels

Test with hosts that have different support levels:

- **Full Support:** Test complete functionality (e.g., Nanobot)
- **Partial Support:** Verify compatibility and graceful degradation (e.g., Goose, LibreChat)
- **Rendering Only:** Ensure fallbacks work correctly (e.g., Smithery, MCPJam)

### Backward Compatibility

Ensure your app:

- Provides text-only fallbacks for all UI-enabled tools
- Returns meaningful content even when UI is unavailable
- Works with both UI-capable and text-only hosts
- Handles missing features gracefully

### Error Handling

Test error scenarios:

- Network failures
- Invalid tool calls
- Missing resources
- Host-specific limitations
- Authentication failures

## Testing Workflow

1. **Start with Postman** - Test basic MCP protocol functionality
2. **Use MCPJam** - Test UI rendering and interactions
3. **Test with Multiple Hosts** - Verify compatibility across different hosts
4. **Test Error Cases** - Ensure graceful handling of failures
5. **Validate Fallbacks** - Confirm text-only mode works correctly
