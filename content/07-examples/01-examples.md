## About Tags

Examples are tagged to indicate which platform(s) they support:

- **`ChatGPT App`** - Built using the OpenAI Apps SDK and available in ChatGPT
- **`MCP App`** - Built using the MCP Apps Extension (SEP-1865) and works with MCP-compatible hosts
- Examples can have multiple tags if they support both platforms

**Note:** MCP-UI was the original name for what is now called MCP Apps. The name change occurred in November 2025 as part of the standardization process. Apps built with MCP-UI are compatible with the MCP Apps Extension standard.
