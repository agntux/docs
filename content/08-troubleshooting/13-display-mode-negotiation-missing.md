### Display Mode Negotiation Missing

**Summary:** The MCP Apps Extension specification (SEP-1865) is missing display mode negotiation, making it unclear how apps and hosts should negotiate and communicate about display modes (inline, fullscreen, PiP).

**Solution:**
1. Monitor the SEP-1865 specification for updates on display mode negotiation
2. Check the MCP Apps Extension repository for discussions or proposals on this feature
3. For now, rely on host-specific implementations for display mode handling
4. Follow the Apps SDK approach if building for both platforms
5. Check GitHub issues and discussions for workarounds or proposed solutions
