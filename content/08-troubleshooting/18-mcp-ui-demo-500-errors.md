### MCP-UI Live Demo Returning 500 Errors

**Summary:** The live demo on the MCP-UI website is not working, with all API calls returning 500 (Internal Server Error) status codes, preventing users from testing MCP-UI functionality.

**Solution:**
1. Check if the issue is temporary - demo services may experience outages
2. Try accessing the demo at a later time if it's a server-side issue
3. Check the MCP-UI repository for any announcements about demo availability
4. Consider setting up a local development environment to test MCP-UI instead
5. Monitor the GitHub issues for updates on demo status
6. Use alternative testing methods like MCP Inspector or local examples
