### Failed to Load Subscription and Connectors

**Summary:** When trying to connect a ChatGPT App in business plan, developers encounter errors: "Failed to Load subscription" and "Failed to load connectors", preventing the app from being connected and used.

**Solution:**
1. Verify your OpenAI account has the necessary subscription tier (business plan or higher)
2. Check that your app is properly configured in the OpenAI platform
3. Ensure all required API keys and credentials are correctly set
4. Verify the connector configuration matches the expected format
5. Check for any account-level restrictions or limitations
6. Review OpenAI's documentation for business plan requirements
7. Contact OpenAI support if the issue persists after verifying configuration
