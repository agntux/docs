### React Version Compatibility Error in Goose

**Summary:** The MCP-UI Client SDK encounters React version compatibility errors when used with the Goose host, causing the app to fail to render or function incorrectly.

**Solution:**
1. Check the React version requirements for the MCP-UI Client SDK
2. Verify the Goose host's React version matches SDK requirements
3. Update React to a compatible version if there's a mismatch
4. Check for peer dependency warnings during installation
5. Review the MCP-UI documentation for React version requirements
6. Consider using React version resolution in your package manager if using multiple React instances
